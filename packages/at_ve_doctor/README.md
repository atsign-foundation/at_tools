## at_ve_doctor

at_ve_doctor is a simple utility than can check the state of the secondaries
running in the virtual environment (VE).  
The virtual environment provides the full atPlatform stack including an atRoot
server and a number of preconfigured atSigns.

Once the virtual environment is up and running the at_ve_doctor can be run
and it will report back the state of each of the preconfigured atSigns.

Before the atSigns are paired with a device they will report as being in a
"teapot" once paired and a pkam key is in place they will report as
"activated".

Activation can be done via the onboarding widget or if you prefer to
activate all the atSigns with predefined pkam keys the pkamLoad script
can be run on the supervisor Ui found at localhost:9001 when running the VE.
